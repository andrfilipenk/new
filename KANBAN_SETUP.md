# Kanban Board Implementation - Setup and Testing Guide

## Overview

This implementation extends the existing task management system with a fully functional Kanban board interface. The system provides drag-and-drop task management, real-time updates, and comprehensive logging.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Components
- ✅ Enhanced Task Model with position tracking and movement methods
- ✅ Updated TaskStatus Model with kanban display properties and validation
- ✅ KanbanService for business logic (movement validation, position calculation)
- ✅ KanbanController with comprehensive API endpoints
- ✅ Enhanced TaskLog Model for detailed movement tracking
- ✅ NotificationService for task movement and assignment notifications
- ✅ Event-driven architecture with proper event handlers
- ✅ Database migration for kanban-specific fields

### Frontend Components
- ✅ Responsive Kanban board view with Steroids.dev integration
- ✅ Drag-and-drop functionality with HTML5 APIs
- ✅ Real-time task movement with optimistic updates
- ✅ Task creation and editing forms
- ✅ Filtering and search capabilities
- ✅ Task detail modals with activity logs
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### API Endpoints
- `GET /kanban` - Render kanban board view
- `GET /kanban/board` - Get board data (JSON API)
- `POST /kanban/task/create` - Create new task
- `PUT /kanban/task/{id}/move` - Move task between statuses
- `PUT /kanban/task/{id}/update` - Update task properties
- `GET /kanban/task/{id}/details` - Get detailed task information

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration to add kanban-specific fields:

```bash
php migrations/run.php 2025_10_05_100000_update_tasks_for_kanban.php
```

This migration adds:
- `position` field to task table
- `description` field to task table  
- `position` and `is_active` fields to task_status table
- Enhanced task_log table with user_id, log_type, and metadata
- Performance indexes for kanban queries

### 2. Verify Module Registration

Ensure the Intern module is properly registered in your application configuration.

### 3. Configure Routes

The routes are automatically configured in `app/Intern/config.php`. Verify that your routing system loads module routes.

### 4. Set Up Events Manager

Ensure your application has an events manager configured in the DI container:

```php
$di->set('eventsManager', function() {
    return new \Core\Events\Manager();
});
```

### 5. Frontend Assets

Ensure the following assets are accessible:
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 CSS/JS (loaded from CDN)
- Font Awesome icons (loaded from CDN)
- Custom kanban.js (included in public/js/)

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Unit Tests

Run the KanbanService unit tests:

```bash
phpunit tests/Unit/Intern/Service/KanbanServiceTest.php
```

Tests cover:
- Task position calculation
- Status transition validation  
- Task movement logic
- Board layout retrieval
- Error handling scenarios

### 2. Integration Tests

Run the API integration tests:

```bash
phpunit tests/Integration/Intern/KanbanApiTest.php
```

Tests cover:
- API endpoint responses
- CSRF protection
- Authentication requirements
- Data validation
- Concurrent operations
- Position recalculation

### 3. Manual Testing Workflow

#### A. Basic Kanban Operations

1. **Access Kanban Board**
   - Navigate to `/kanban`
   - Verify board loads with correct status columns
   - Check that existing tasks appear in appropriate columns

2. **Task Movement**
   - Drag a task from "New" to "In Progress"
   - Verify task moves visually
   - Check database for updated status_id and position
   - Verify task log entry is created

3. **Task Creation**
   - Click "Add New Task" button
   - Fill out task form with required fields
   - Submit and verify task appears in selected status column
   - Check that task log shows creation entry

4. **Task Details**
   - Click on any task card
   - Verify task details modal opens
   - Check that activity log shows recent changes
   - Verify all task properties are displayed correctly

#### B. Advanced Features Testing

1. **Filtering**
   - Use assignee filter to show only specific user's tasks
   - Use priority filter to show only certain priorities
   - Verify filters work correctly and can be cleared

2. **Position Management**
   - Drag task to specific position within a column
   - Verify other tasks adjust positions automatically
   - Move multiple tasks and check position consistency

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Try invalid status transitions (e.g., Completed → On Hold)
   - Verify validation errors are displayed
   - Test with missing required fields
   - Test CSRF protection by removing token

#### C. Event System Testing

1. **Logging Verification**
   - Check task_log table for movement entries
   - Verify log entries contain proper metadata
   - Check that user information is recorded correctly

2. **Notification System**
   - Monitor application logs for notification events
   - Verify notifications are triggered for:
     - Task assignments
     - Status changes
     - Task updates

#### D. Performance Testing

1. **Large Dataset Testing**
   - Create 50+ tasks across different statuses
   - Test board loading performance
   - Verify drag-and-drop remains responsive
   - Check database query performance

2. **Concurrent User Testing**
   - Simulate multiple users moving tasks simultaneously
   - Verify position conflicts are resolved
   - Check that real-time updates work correctly

## Architecture Validation

### Data Flow Verification

1. **Frontend → Backend**
   - User drags task → JavaScript captures event
   - AJAX request sent to `/kanban/task/{id}/move`
   - KanbanController receives request
   - KanbanService validates and processes movement
   - Task model updated with new position/status
   - Events fired for logging and notifications

2. **Event Processing**
   - Task movement triggers `kanban.taskMoved` event
   - TaskLog model creates audit entry
   - NotificationService sends relevant notifications
   - Frontend receives success response and updates UI

### Security Verification

1. **CSRF Protection**
   - All POST/PUT requests require valid CSRF token
   - Token validation occurs before processing

2. **Authentication**
   - All kanban endpoints require authenticated user
   - User permissions are checked appropriately

3. **Input Validation**
   - Task data is validated before persistence
   - Status transition rules are enforced
   - Position values are sanitized

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tasks Not Moving**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify CSRF token is present and valid
   - Check database connection and migration status

2. **Drag-and-Drop Not Working**
   - Ensure modern browser with HTML5 support
   - Check for JavaScript conflicts
   - Verify kanban.js is loaded correctly

3. **API Errors**
   - Check application error logs
   - Verify routing configuration
   - Ensure database tables exist and are properly structured

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Check database indexes are applied
   - Monitor query performance with large datasets
   - Verify frontend optimizations are active

## Customization Options

### Adding New Status Columns
1. Insert new record in `task_status` table
2. Set appropriate `position` and `is_active` values
3. Update `TaskStatus::isValidTransition()` method if needed

### Modifying Notification Behavior
1. Update event handlers in `Intern\Module::registerKanbanEventHandlers()`
2. Extend `NotificationService` with additional methods
3. Add new event types as needed

### Extending Task Properties
1. Add new fields to task migration
2. Update Task model's `$fillable` array
3. Modify frontend form and validation
4. Update API endpoints to handle new fields

## Production Deployment Checklist
